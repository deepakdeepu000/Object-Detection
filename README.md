# Object Detection React Application

## Overview

This project is an object detection application built with React. It enables users to upload images, which are processed using the Amazon Rekognition API to detect and identify objects within the images. The application displays the detected labels along with their confidence scores, providing valuable insights into the content of the images.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload images from their devices.
- **Label Detection**: Utilizes the Amazon Rekognition API to detect and return labels for objects in the uploaded images.
- **Results Display**: Detected labels are shown alongside their confidence scores, offering a clear understanding of the identified objects.
